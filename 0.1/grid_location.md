# Grid Location

Hyperledger Grid Location is a framework for sharing location master data 
between trade partners. The framework is built in a generic and extensible way 
to allow for flexibility in serving various use cases and specialized industries. 
The first extension of this framework – a GS1 compliant Location – is built and 
allows organizations to harness the power of a widely adopted industry standard. 
Location is a universal concept within the supply chain and is naturally one of 
the highest areas of re-use across Grid applications.


## What’s the benefit to using Grid Location?

Grid Location allows an organization to uniquely identify a location and share 
that location with trade partners. This foundational capability serves as the 
WHERE dimension within Grid, enabling a wide host of distributed supply chain 
and commerce solutions. The framework can stand alone or pair with other Grid 
capabilities to support use cases such as:

- **Track and Trace.** Visibility into where was a product sourced from, what 
locations the product has passed through, where the product is now, where
the product is destined, and more.
- **Inventory & Warehouse Management.** Visibility into what inventory stock levels 
look like across my network.
- **Order Management.** Visibility into what Sold To, Ship To, and Bill To 
locations are relevant for a purchase order and related documents such as Bill 
of Lading, Receipt of Goods, Invoice, etc.

Location information can also enrich user experiences through the display of 
location attribution. Imagine a front-end interface where you can view location 
names, addresses, and contacts alongside your business transactions.


## What do we consider a Location?

A location can mean more than a physical space. Check out the four different 
types of locations our GS1 compliant Location supports below or by visiting the
[GS1 General Specifications](https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes-epcrfid-id-keys/gs1-general-specifications).

- **Legal entities.** Any business, government body, department, charity, individual
or institution that has standing in the eyes of the law and has the capacity to 
enter into contracts. Examples: Whole companies, subsidiaries or divisions. 
Suppliers, distributors, banks, freight carriers, etc.
- **Functional entities.** A specific department within a legal entity. Examples: 
accounting accounts payable, returns.
- **Physical locations.** A site (an area, a structure or group of structures) or 
an area within the site where something was, is, or will be located. Examples: 
Retail store, manufacturing facility, warehouse, distribution center, dock door, 
floor number, section of floor, room, shelf, section on shelf.
- **Digital locations.** An electronic (non-physical) address that is used for 
communication between computer systems. Example: ERP system.

## Grid Location Sapling

The Grid Location Sapling is a user interface (UI) plug-in that allows a user 
to interact with the features described above. This front-end interface is
under development. Once built, the sapling will allow business users to refine,
consume and transact with the underlying smart contracts in a user-friendly way.
Stay tuned for the Grid Location visual design and implementation.
